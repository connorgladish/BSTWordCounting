## Binary Search Tree Implementation
# `CJ Gladish`
# Date: `December 6, 2024`
---
## Features Tested:
- `set` - Inserts or updates key-value pairs in the tree.
- `find` - Retrieves the value associated with a specific key.
- `print` - Prints all key-value pairs in sorted order (in-order traversal).
- `min` - Finds the smallest key in the tree.
- `max` - Finds the largest key in the tree.
- `save_file` - Writes the tree's contents to a file in sorted order.
- `delete_node` - Removes a node by its key.
---
## Word Count (Bonus) - Processes a text file and counts word occurrences.
# Compilation Instructions:
- To compile: `make`
- To run: `./driver`
## To clean object files and executables: `make clean`
# Test:
- The program allows interactive testing through a menu. A sample `test.dat` file was used to test:
- Word insertion and updates with set.
- Retrieval of values with find.
- Loading and counting words from `test.dat` for word count functionality.
- Tree traversal, deletion, and saving contents to `output.txt.`
